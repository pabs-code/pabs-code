# Machine Learning and Computer Vision Enthusiast

Hi all!

## About Me

I'm a passionate learner interested in the fields of Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML), with a particular focus on Computer Vision (CV). My journey in these areas began with studying the foundations of ML and diving into OpenCV.

## What I'm Up To

- **Learning Path**: Currently, I am solidifying my understanding of foundational ML concepts and exploring the powerful image processing capabilities of OpenCV.
- **Goals**: My ultimate goal is to engage in collaborative projects that allow me to apply and expand my knowledge in DL, CV, and ML.
- **Technologies**: I'm familiar with Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, and OpenCV.

## Connect With Me

I'm open to collaborations on various DL/CV/ML projects. If you have any interesting ideas or want to discuss potential projects, feel free to reach out!
